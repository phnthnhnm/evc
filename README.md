# EVC GUI

## About

I made this app because I use the Echo Value Calculator website a lot, but I really wanted a way to save echo presets; and honestly, the web UI could use some love. So I built a cross-platform Flutter app for it!

This was also my excuse to learn Flutter, so the code might be a bit messy. If you spot something weird, that's probably why.

Full credit goes to [AstyuteChick](https://github.com/AstyuteChick) for making the original calculator. This app just wraps their awesome backend with a friendlier UI, as well as echo saving functionality.

## How to Use

For instructions, just check out the [official guide](https://www.echovaluecalc.com/instruct) from the Echo Value Calculator website.
